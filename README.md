# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

Project Overview

 In this project, I have utilized SQL queries to analyze and answer business-related questions based on pizza sales data. By applying various SQL techniques such as filtering, aggregation, joins, and grouping, I was able to uncover insights into  customer preferences, and overall business performance. This analysis helps in understanding which pizzas are most popular, peak ordering times, and key factors that drive sales.


## Objective

- Extract, clean, and organize pizza sales data for analysis.
- Identify top-selling and least-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue.
- Analyze daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends.
- Evaluate customer order patterns (e.g., order size, frequency, peak hours).
- Measure revenue contribution by pizza category and size.

## Business Problems and Solutions

## BASIC QUESTIONS

### 1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

```sql
select count(order_id) as Total_order from orders;
```



### 2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(o.quantity * p.price), 2) AS Total_sales
FROM
    order_detail AS o
        JOIN
    pizzas AS p ON o.Pizza_id = p.pizza_id;
```


### 3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.name, o.price
FROM
    pizza_types AS p
        JOIN
    pizzas AS o ON p.pizza_type_id = o.pizza_type_id
ORDER BY o.price DESC
LIMIT 5;

```


### 4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.size, 
	sum(o.Quantity)
FROM
    pizzas AS p
        JOIN
    order_detail AS o ON p.pizza_id = o.Pizza_id
GROUP BY p.size
ORDER BY sum(o.Quantity) DESC;

```


### 5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.


```sql
SELECT 
    p.name, SUM(o.quantity) AS Quantity
FROM
    pizza_types AS p
        JOIN
    pizzas AS q ON p.pizza_type_id = q.pizza_type_id
        JOIN
    order_detail AS o ON o.Pizza_id = q.pizza_id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY SUM(o.quantity) DESC
LIMIT 5;

```

## INTERMIDIATE QUESTIONS


### 1. Join the necessary tables to find the 
###   total quantity of each pizza category ordered.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.category, SUM(o.quantity)
FROM
    pizza_types AS p
        JOIN
    pizzas AS q ON p.pizza_type_id = q.pizza_type_id
        JOIN
    order_detail AS o ON o.Pizza_id = q.pizza_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY SUM(o.quantity) DESC;

```



### 2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.

```sql
SELECT 
    HOUR(Order_time), COUNT(Order_id)
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY HOUR(Order_time);
```


### 3. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

```sql
SELECT 
    category, COUNT(name)
FROM
    pizza_types
GROUP BY category;
```



### 4. Group the orders by date and calculate the average 
###    number of pizzas ordered per day.

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(quant), 0)
FROM
    (SELECT 
        o.Order_date, SUM(q.quantity) AS quant
    FROM
        orders AS o
    JOIN order_detail AS q ON o.Order_id = q.Order_id
    GROUP BY o.Order_date) AS ordered_quantity;
```



### 5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.name, SUM(o.quantity * q.price) AS revenue
FROM
    pizza_types AS p
        JOIN
    pizzas AS q ON p.pizza_type_id = q.pizza_type_id
        JOIN
    order_detail AS o ON o.Pizza_id = q.pizza_id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
```


## ADVANCED QUESTIONS


### 1. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.category,
    round((SUM(o.Quantity * q.price) / (SELECT 
            ROUND(SUM(o.quantity * q.price), 2) AS Total_sales
        FROM
            order_detail AS o
                JOIN
            pizzas AS q ON o.Pizza_id = q.pizza_id)) * 100, 2) AS revenue
FROM
    pizza_types AS p
        JOIN
    pizzas AS q ON p.pizza_type_id = q.pizza_type_id
        JOIN
    order_detail AS o ON o.Pizza_id = q.pizza_id
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```


### 2. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.

```sql
select Order_date, 
sum(revenue) over(order by Order_date) as cum_revenue
 from
(select o.Order_date,
sum(q.quantity * p.price) as revenue
from order_detail as q
join pizzas as p
on q.Pizza_id = p.Pizza_id
join orders as o
on o.Order_id = q.Order_id
group by o.Order_date) as sales;
```


### 3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on 
###    revenue for each pizza category.

```sql
select category,name,  revenue from
(select	category, name, revenue, 
rank() over(partition by category order by revenue) as Ranks 
from
(select p.category, p.name,
sum(o.quantity * q.price) as revenue
from pizza_types as p
join pizzas as q
on p.pizza_type_id = q.pizza_type_id
join order_detail as o
on o.Pizza_id = q.pizza_id
group by p.category, p.name) as a) as b
where Ranks <= 3;
```

## Findings and Conclusion

- **Revenue drivers:** Premium/larger pizzas contribute more to total revenue despite fewer orders.
- **Peak order times:** Most sales occur during lunch (12–2 PM) and dinner (6–9 PM).
- **Low performers:** Some specialty pizzas contribute very little to sales and may need re-evaluation.
- **Best-selling pizzas:** Certain pizza types generate the highest sales volume.
