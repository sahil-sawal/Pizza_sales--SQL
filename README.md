# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

Project Overview

 In this project, I have utilized SQL queries to analyze and answer business-related questions based on pizza sales data. By applying various SQL techniques such as filtering, aggregation, joins, and grouping, I was able to uncover insights into  customer preferences, and overall business performance. This analysis helps in understanding which pizzas are most popular, peak ordering times, and key factors that drive sales.


## Objective

- Extract, clean, and organize pizza sales data for analysis.
- Identify top-selling and least-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue.
- Analyze daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends.
- Evaluate customer order patterns (e.g., order size, frequency, peak hours).
- Measure revenue contribution by pizza category and size.
